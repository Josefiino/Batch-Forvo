**Batch Forvo**

This addon makes it possible to batch add forvo audio to a specific field, that can be set within the config.

This addon is based on **Simple Free Forvo Audio Downloader** that can be found at https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/560814150. Which I highly recommend. 

Files are saved in *.ogg* format and might not work in all devices.

"*field_to_read*" = Search will be based on the content of this field
"*field_to_add*" = Selected text in the dialog will **ADD** to this field
"*shortcut*" = Define a Shortcut to run the main function
"*languageCode*" = Language in wich the addon will search forvo
"*downloadPath*" = I don't really know, it is just necessary for it to work. Don't change it.

This is just a quick edit on the original addon to serve a purpose, so it's not really polished.
It works from the browser, select all the cards you want and press the shortcut or via the menu and wait for the dialog with the confirmation it finished. It might take a while so I suggest you use it in smaller batches.
